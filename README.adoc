= youtube-batch-dl

Search & download youtube videos from a list of search terms, with an edge for music downloading.

== Installation

Install the gem by typing:

    $ gem install youtube_batch_dl

== Usage

`youtube-batch-dl` is made up of different _subcommands_ that you can use to achieve different tasks.

=== The `config` command
This command provides a simple way to read & write to a config file saved to `~/.config/youtube-batch-dl/config.yaml`. 

The command is used as follows:

[horizontal]
`config get SETTING [SETTING \...]`:: Displays `SETTING` 's value(s). If `SETTING` is `all`, display every possible setting with its value (in *red* when the setting isn't set to its default value)
`config set SETTING VALUE`:: Sets `SETTING` to `VALUE`
`config reset SETTING`:: Resets `SETTING` to its default value. If `SETTING` is `all`, ask for confirmation and reset every setting
`config open`:: Opens `~/.config/youtube-batch-dl/config.yaml` with `$EDITOR` (falls back to `nano`). Use `--with`/`-w` to explicitly specify which command should receive the path.

=== The `list [FILES...]` command
Lists all tracks in `FILES...` (use `in_file` as a default), and for each one, shows whether it has been downloaded, is disabled or is to be downloaded
==== Options
[horizontal]
`-m/--fetch-metadata`:: Fetches metadata from spotify (such as album name) to display it along the track's name & artist
`-D/--exclude-disabled`:: Don't show disabled tracks (commented-out)
`-L/--exclude-downloaded`:: Don't show already-downloaded tracks

=== The `start [RESOURCES...]` command
The main command. Starts up the downloading/metadata tagging process, using tracks specified within `RESOURCES...`. `RESOURCES...` defaults to the `in_file` config setting.

Within can be one of...
- spotify playlist URL
- spotify album URL
- 

==== Flags
[horizontal]
`-v/--video-mode`:: Shortcut for `--video` and `--no-metadata`
`--video`:: Downloads as a `.mp4`.
`--no-metadata`:: Does not try to apply metadata.
`-f/--format` or `--as`:: Specify the format used to download the file. Supported formats are `.mp3`, `.mp4`, `.m4a`, `.wav`, `.flac` and `.ogg`.

=== The `add TRACKNAME [FILE]` command
Appends `TRACKNAME` to `FILE` (uses the `in_file` setting as a default)


=== The `deactivate TRACKNAME [FILE]`
Comments out *all occurences* of `TRACKNAME` in `FILE` (uses the `in_file` setting as a default).

==== Flags
[horizontal]
`-c/--because REASON`:: Specify _why_ you disabled that track.
`-f [NUM]/--first [NUM]`:: Only deletes the first `NUM` occurence(s) of `TRACKNAME`. `NUM`  defaults to 1.

=== The `remove TRACKNAME [FILE]` command
Same as `deactivate`, but *deletes* entries. The `--because` flag is not available. Note that this action *cannot* be undone.

=== The `addstart TRACKNAME` command
Shorcut for executing `add TRACKNAME` and `start`

=== The `oneshot TERM [TERM ...]` command
Instead of the standard procedure, downloads in the current directory and do not check if the track has already been downloaded. `TERM` can be one of:

- YouTube URL
- YouTube video ID
- Track name, in the same format as the one used by the `from FILE` command.

== Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to https://rubygems.org[rubygems.org].
